/* A hotel has data about which of their hotel rooms are reserved. The data for each reservation
takes the form of a starting data and an ending date. THey want to be able to find out which
data ranges have no reservations for any rooms, or "gaps". They have data for all reservations,
 but only want to find out the gaps between a specific start and end date.

 So, given a list of these reservations, a report start date, and a report end date, return a 
 list of gaps that occur within that range
